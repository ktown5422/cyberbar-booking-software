This is reflected in the price difference between the two phones. The iPhone 6S has added sensors in the screen which allows 3D touch which measures soft to more forceful touches. If the screen on your iPhone 6S is cracked and does not work or has display issues such as lines, bleeding ink blotches or the touch just completely doesn’t work anymore. This repair will fix all issues as the glass and display screen with the 3D touch sensors will all be replaced with this service. Your iPhone 6S will go back to normal function after the repair is complete. The iPhone 6S display is the same size as those of the iPhone 6, coming in 4.7-inches. The difference is the iPhone 6S features a technology known as 3D Touch; sensors are embedded in the screen’s backlight layer that measure the firmness of the user’s touch input by the distance between it and the cover glass, allowing the device to distinguish between normal and more forceful presses. 3D Touch is combined with a Taptic Engine vibrator to provide associated haptic feedback. Due to the hardware needed to implement 3D Touch, the iPhone 6S is heavier than its predecessor. The iPhone 6S features a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera, an upgrade from the 8-megapixel unit on previous models, as well as a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. It can record 4K video, as well as 1080p video at 60 frames per second.'

The iPhone X uses an OLED screen just like the Samsung phones use. Thats the reason why the iPhone X is more then double the price then any other iPhone repair that came before it. In the market there is a knockoff LCD type screen available for the iPhone X which will not be the same as the stock original one that comes on the phone. The screen can overheat, the colors are off, and the screen will lag when you swipe through things fast. You will not receive the aftermarket LCD screen, You will only receive the high end OLED display with this repair. I do not offer or recommend the Knockoff iPhone X LCD screen on a $1,000 phone.'
